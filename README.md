# Murmuration
v0.0.4-alpha

Murmuration  is an implementation of a torrent client written in Swift. The hope
is to make a Mac-native GUI torrent client written completely in Swift and SwiftUI. 
Using Swift to build familiarity in the language, and hopefully to reuse a lot of this
work to make a phone app manager for the torrent client that runs on iOS.

Starting functionality is to write a command line tool that the GUI will use the API of to
manage torrents.

Currently working on implementing the torrent cli. Bencode interpreter current'y working.
