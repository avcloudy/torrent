// MARK: bencode
// ##############################
// bencode.swift
//
// defines bencode as an enum type
// conceptually, this lives here because both decode and encode use bencode
// practically only decode does, so this could move there
// originally defined here as it contained a recursive walker but practically
// works better as an explicit function in decode
//
// model was incoming data (from .torrent, tracker or clients) comes in as bencode type
// decoded to native types, then when sending out to tracker or clients gets reencoded
// practically data coming in is stream of bytes and only becomes bencode when it's
// decoded as a union type for arrays and dictionaries
// bencode type only exists after decoding, and only temporarily
